Measurements in a sound attenuated room Chair of Sensor Technology

Sound pressure level measurement at a distance of 50cm from the loudspeaker; Speaker installed on stepper motor that rotates from -90 to +90 degrees in 1.8 degree steps. One measurement is carried out per turning step. Monofrequency excitation from 20kHz to 160kHz in 500Hz steps. U_anreg = 600Vpp. The measurements were carried out with a 1/8 inch GRAS pressure microphone. A correction characteristic curve was applied which takes the following effects into account: free field correction, pressure build-up effect, protective grid correction.

The measurements are saved as * .mat. Each file contains a 281x101 matrix

281 frequency steps (20kHz to 160kHz)
101 angles (51st column = vertical sound incidence)

Each cell contains the sound pressure level in dB

The table in this folder provides an overview of the file names.
